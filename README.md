*- "The project for the most brutal and effective language learning technique" (c) Alex Kay*

  The langflow project was created especially for language learning by using the most direct way. 
A method demands to work passionately and regularly. The main idea of the method is constant recall by students writing sentences in language which he would like to improve! 

  The natural way of learning by this technique reminds reinforcement learning which became one the most effective ways in ML. Just make the parallel between these both and find this as a way of learning if it is convenient for you!

# How to use
In the beginning, you will be asked to choose your first language (language you already know) and second language (language you are going to improve). Also, you will be asked to choose a level. just follow instructions:

```
    Hello! Choose language pair you want to learn!
    Among next available languages:
    {1: 'english', 2: 'russian', 3: 'french'}

    and starting level:
    {1: 'level1'}
    
First language id : 1
Second language id: 3
Level id: 1
```

After choosing the settings of your session here you go!
You will be asked to translate the sentence into a second language. 
Don't be confused about constant writing, this is part of the idea of learning!

The two possible cases are represented below! 
```
Cool! You have choosed: [english-french]
Phrase #1            >> I don't watch such kinds of movies
Translate            >> Je ne regarde pas de tels types de films
Right answer!       

Phrase #2            >> This is our city
Translate            >> C'est notre vile
Bad answer           >> C'est notre ville
Repeat please        >> C'est notre ville
Well!                >> C'est notre ville
```
